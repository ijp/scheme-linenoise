# About

Linenoise is a small self-contained alternative to readline and
libedit written by Salvatore Sanfilippo. It can be found at
http://http://github.com/antirez/linenoise

This was a set of R6RS Scheme bindings for it to test out (ucl ffi) by
Will Donnelly. http://http://github.com/willdonnelly/ucl-ffi


# Install

A Makefile is included for building and installing a shared library
version of Linenoise. A simple `make && sudo make install` should
suffice if /usr/local/lib is on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

linenoise.sls and linenoise/main.sls will need to be placed in the
library path for your scheme.

This library was tested with Ikarus 0.04-rc1+, Ypsilon 0.9.6-trunk/r503,
Mosh 0.2.5, and the plt-r6rs executable of Racket v5.0.

It's only dependency is ucl-ffi by Will Donnelly


# Possible Improvements

- Write a MANIFEST for use with (ucl install)
- Add srfi 39 parameters for current-linenoise-prompt and
  current-history-file and let history-save!/history-load!/linenoise
  take either 0 or 1 parameters.
- Allow arguments to be bytevectors?
